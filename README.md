# COVID 19 - Nursing Home Data - Test Positivity Rates

You can find the data [here](https://data.cms.gov/widgets/hsg2-yqzz) and on primer [here](https://data.cms.gov/Special-Programs-Initiatives-COVID-19-Nursing-Home/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Data-Test-Positivity-Rates/hsg2-yqzz). In both cases it is a zip file and not very useful. 

you can download the up to date zip file [here](https://data.cms.gov/download/hsg2-yqzz/application%2Fzip)

I have created this scrip to regularly download and save the data in a json file `cms_ltc.json.`

Later I want to figure out how to store it and alert off of it. For right now, the history is stored in the git history. One day I will make it a fancy sqlite file and all will be good.
